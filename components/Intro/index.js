    <h2>My frontend journey so far</h2>
    <p>I have always had an interest in websites, how they look and function. I have been freelancing since 2016 building basic Wordpress websites on side. It was until a couple of years ago that my frontend web developer journey sky rocketed when a friend started mentoring me and guided me in developing solid skills in html, css and javascript.
    </p>
    <p>I started working at Magnetic Creative in 2019 as a junior front end web developer. The tech stack was primarily custom Wordpress dockerised with postcss and ACF for customising the backend for customers. The languages I worked with was php, html, postscss, javascript. The highlight was working with a team of developers and utilising version control via GitHub.</p>
    <p>In 2021 I took a break from agency life and joined a startup called Orderin as front end web developer. I developed valuable skills in REACT.js, working with Gatsby.js, next.js, storybook and storyblok. The highlight was developing a design system for orderin with REACT and typescript.</p>
